This is my Kicad version of http://www.christle.us/index.php?P=1

I replaced the SIP resistor network with traditional through hole resistors.

I added a blue user led connected to PA1 and I added a reset button.

I removed the 5V regulator and provided a standard 2 pin JST connector for external +5V supply (not normally required as the Serial socket connected to a FTDI like USB to serial adapter will provide the necessary +5V).
